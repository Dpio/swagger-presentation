# AllignApiNUiWithSwagger
The repository created for SIITechTalk which idea is to share knowledge about tools and tricks that are useful in everyday work.  Things that I will put here are really basic and their goal is to show people that didn't use Swagger (https://swagger.io/), or they were using it only for creating the specification.  This is a small sample of how easy is to add swagger to the project and how it can help you to align API methods with UI part using NSwag (https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag).
